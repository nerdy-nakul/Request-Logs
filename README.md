# Request-Logs

Request-Logs is a lightweight Node.js application designed to log every HTTP request made to your server. It helps developers monitor and analyze incoming traffic by generating detailed log files for each request. This tool is ideal for debugging, performance monitoring, and security auditing, providing comprehensive insights into your server's activity.

## Features

- Logs details of every HTTP request including headers, method, URL, timestamp, and client IP address.
- Generates structured log files for each day, facilitating easy analysis and troubleshooting.
- Simple integration with existing Node.js applications.
- Customizable logging options to suit various use cases.
- Lightweight and efficient, ensuring minimal impact on server performance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Request-Logs.git
    cd Request-Logs
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start logging HTTP requests, you can run the application in different modes:

- **Production Mode:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

- **Development Mode (with nodemon):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Make sure to replace `server.js` with the filename where your server logic resides.

## How It Works

The application listens for incoming HTTP requests and logs relevant details to a file. Each log entry includes:

- **Request Time**: Timestamp when the request was received.
- **Request Method**: HTTP method used (e.g., GET, POST).
- **Request Pathname**: URL path requested.
- **Request Host**: Hostname of the server.
- **Request IP**: IP address of the client making the request.
- **Request Headers**: Headers sent with the request.
- **Query Parameters**: Query parameters included in the URL.

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory within the project, organized by date (`logFile - YYYY-MM-DD.txt`).
